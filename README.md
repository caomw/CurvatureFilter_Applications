# CurvatureFilter_Applications
This shows example applications of curvature filters
## image registration
|I(x) - R(x+u)|^DataFitOrder + Lambda * | curvature(u) |, where u is the motion field.
## image dehaze
I(x) = t(x)R(x) + (1-t(x))A, where t(x) is the transmission map. We can minimize the curvature(t(x))
## image decomposition
## image enhancement
## image segmentation
